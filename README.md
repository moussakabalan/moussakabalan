## 🚀 About Me
I'm Moussa, but most people call me **Moose**! I’m a Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate who enjoys exploring how things work at every level—from low-level code and APIs to large-scale systems. I like taking things apart, understanding them, and finding better ways to build them back up.

I’ve built projects that have reached **over 300 million users worldwide** 📈, giving me hands-on experience with performance, scalability, and user-focused design. **Roblox** was where I first started building at scale, teaching me how to design engaging systems, optimize backend logic, and support live operations for massive audiences.

While I remain active on the Roblox platform, I’ve also expanded my knowledge into deeper software engineering, with a growing focus on **👾 cybersecurity and reverse engineering 💻**. Since I favor backend engineering, I enjoy tackling the *"behind-the-scenes"* challenges that improve performance, reliability, and security.

💡 A fun fact about me is that I love tinkering with electronics in my free time—whether it’s taking them apart to understand the internals or diving into how their software logic works.  

Here on GitHub, you’ll find my personal projects and contributions that reflect my curiosity, backend-driven approach, and commitment to always learning and growing.
