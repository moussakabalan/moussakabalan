## 🚀 About Me
I’m Moussa (*Moose*), a Computer Science & Engineering undergraduate with a passion for backend engineering and systems design. I first got my start in large-scale development through **Roblox**, where I learned how to build and optimize systems that scale—reaching **millions of users worldwide**.  

These days, while I continue to develop on the Roblox platform and set new milestones, my interests extend into **cybersecurity and reverse engineering**, where I enjoy tackling *"behind-the-scenes"* challenges that make software faster, more reliable, and more secure.  

💡 Fun fact: I love tinkering with electronics in my free time, taking them apart to understand the internals and the logic that drives them.

## 🛠️ Skills & Interests
I'm pretty familiar with **C++, JavaScript/NodeJS, Java, Lua, and Python.** I'm *somewhat* okay at C# and I'm *still trying* with Assmebly lol. Currently focused on backend-systems engineering, security, and large-scale software design with a newfound interest in cybersecurity and reverse engineering!
